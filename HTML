			<p>Baby goats (kids) are standing and taking their first steps within minutes of being born.
Each kid has a unique call, and along with its scent, that is how its mother recognizes it from birth – not by sight. .
Goats, being mountain animals, are very good at climbing; they’ve been known to climb to the tops of trees, or even dams!</p>
